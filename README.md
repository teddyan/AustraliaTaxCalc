# This project is my first interview in Australia

## How my application looks like:

Main Page: - You can select your country, income Year and enter income here.

Result Page - if income is greater than 180,000:

Result Page - if income is greater than 120,001 but less than 180,000:

Result Page - if income is greater than 45,001 but less than 120,000:

the estimated taxable income will be calculated automatically when you enter your total income.

and I followed the rule from Australia Government. (https://www.ato.gov.au/rates/individual-income-tax-rates/)

## Their Excercise:

The solution can be in either React, Vue, Svelte or Angular 9+ (preferred).
chose one of the frontend framework to complete this exercise.

- [x] React
- [ ] Vue
- [ ] Angular
- [ ] Svelte

To be considered a valid solution the application should take in input appropriately and perform the tax calculation correctly for at least one country and income year. As there is no API provided for this task the calculation can be implemented on the frontend. 

# How to use this project

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run build` fails to minify
